# Self-Driving Car using Deep Q-Network (DQN)  

This project demonstrates a **self-driving car simulation** trained with **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**.  
The car learns to navigate its environment, avoid obstacles, and follow the track by trial and error.

## Overview  

- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Network (DQN)  
- **Goal**: Train a car to drive autonomously in a simulated environment  
- **Outcome**: The agent successfully learns lane-following and obstacle avoidance behaviors
